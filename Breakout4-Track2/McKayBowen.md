# Generating Synthetic Data for Data Privacy in R

## Abstract
Data privacy experts from statistics and computer science often use synthetic 
data generation, a technique that generates data with pseudo or "fake" records 
that are statistically representative of the original data, for releasing 
confidential data publicly. In this presentation, I will cover the basics of 
synthetic data generation and how to generate your own synthetic data using R.
