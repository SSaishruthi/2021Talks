# In this tutorial

- How to set up your R ecosystem to support report creation in HTML (and PDF)

--

- Brief overview of table and graphics packages to support analysis

--

- Tips and tricks to make your reports dazzling and reproducible


---

# Not in this tutorial

>- Shiny - we are going to focus on HTML (primary) and PDF (secondary) reports
>- Details of the tables or graphics packages - these could easily be their own tutorials

The good news is several speakers tomorrow will cover Shiny and other graphics applications!

---

# Older process of reporting

- Do analysis in one tool (R/SAS/SPSS/etc.)
--

- Make tables and charts in another tool (Excel)
--

- Paste everything into a text editor (Word/LaTeX)
--

- Turn it into a final product (PDF)

# R Project 

"R experts keep all the files associated with a project together — input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures. This is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects." 
-- Hadley Wickham ([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))

--

R projects define your working directories. This helps keeps paths relative rather than fixed. This makes your work portable and allows you to keep things tidy.

---

# Let's do it!

 1. Open RStudio 
 2. Configure global options to avoid saving .Rdata
     - Tools -> Global Options -> Workspace -> Uncheck the box. Change the dropdown to Never.
     - Restart RStudio
 3. Create an R project to associate with this talk or another set of files

# Embrace the magic of R Markdown

---

# What is R Markdown?

R + Markdown (text-to-HTML conversion tool) = R Markdown

--

R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

 - As an environment for you to do data science.
 - Collaborating with other data scientists with interest in your conclusions and how you reached them (the code).
 - **For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.**

---

# Let's do it!

 1. File -> New File -> R Markdown -> Document -> HTML -> Save
 2. Knit it!
 3. Open the dazzle.Rmd file inside the tutorial folder
     - YAML Header
     - Code chunks
     - Markdown/LaTeX

---

# Dazzling Elements in R Markdown

 - Using parameters in YAML header
 - Hiding code chunks and including 'Easter eggs' for other analysts
 - Using tabs and drop downs to improve pagination
   
---

# Folder Infrastructure

 - Source longer R scripts from an R markdown file
   + Consider outputting summary data set to avoid longer processes when you load a report
 - Don't try to fit too much into one report - store different reports in the same folder if it makes sense
 
 Highly recommend this talk by Emily Riederer from rStudio::conf 2020: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/rmarkdown-driven-development/

# Step 3. Build your content - tables

There are many table packages. For HTML: `DT` and `reactable` are good starting points. For pdf, `kableExtra` is the gold standard.

---

# Step 4. Build your content - plots

`ggplot2` works great as a static graphics package. For interactive graphics, use `plotly` or `highcharter`.

# UX principles for reporting (and almost anything else)

Your report should:

 - Meet the users’ needs 
 - Have a clear hierarchy that makes navigation natural
 - Understand and embrace accessibility - did you know 1 in 12 men are colorblind?
 - Maintain time consistency - transition to or away from ideas slowly
 - Have a narrative - tell a story with your design
